      "3. **Acknowledge the empathetic side** – for the ~7 % of posts that draw 😭, respond with supportive messaging; it shows you’re listening to the more emotional moments.  \n",
      "4. **Monitor for shifts** – a sudden rise in 😭 or a drop in 😂 could signal a change in audience mood that needs attention.  \n",
      "\n",
