      "**📊 5 Key Insights (Beginner‑Friendly)**  \n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Strong overall performance** – The dataset shows **$152 M** in total sales and **$18.4 M** in profit, giving an overall profit margin of **≈12 %** (profit ÷ sales). That’s a healthy baseline for most retail businesses.  \n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Discounts are modest but impactful** – The average discount applied is **≈9.9 %**. Even a small discount can erode profit quickly when volumes are high, so monitoring discount‑driven sales is essential.  \n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Geographic concentration** – Five cities generate almost **$40 M** (≈26 % of total sales). The top city, **Mumbai**, alone contributes **$8.43 M**. This suggests a heavy reliance on a few urban markets.  \n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Loss‑making product categories** – Three categories are dragging profit down:  \n",
      "   - **Technology:** –$10.46 M  \n",
      "   - **Furniture:** –$5.35 M  \n",
      "   - **Office Supplies:** –$2.63 M  \n",
      "   Together they represent **≈$18.5 M** of the total loss, essentially wiping out the entire net profit.  \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Profit vs. sales mismatch** – While sales are high, the profit figure is relatively low because the loss‑making categories offset gains from other lines. This signals that **sales alone are not a reliable health indicator**; profitability per category matters more.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**🚀 3 Practical Recommendations**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Re‑evaluate the Technology, Furniture & Office Supplies lines**  \n",
      "   - Conduct a **margin analysis** (cost + discount vs. price) for each SKU.  \n",
      "   - Consider **price adjustments**, **supplier renegotiations**, or **product rationalization** (dropping low‑margin items).  \n",
      "   - Test a **limited‑time “profit‑first” promotion** (e.g., bundle high‑margin accessories) to boost margins without heavy discounts.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Leverage the top‑5 city stronghold**  \n",
      "   - Deploy **targeted marketing** (local SEO, city‑specific ads) to deepen penetration in Mumbai, Lucknow, Patna, Surat, and Indore.  \n",
      "   - Introduce **city‑specific loyalty programs** or **express delivery** to increase repeat purchase rates.  \n",
      "   - Use these markets as **pilot zones** for new pricing or product experiments before rolling out nationwide.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Implement a discount‑control dashboard**  \n",
      "   - Set a **maximum average discount threshold** (e.g., ≤ 8 %).  \n",
      "   - Flag any transaction or product line that exceeds the threshold for review.  \n",
      "   - Pair discount data with margin impact to ensure promotions are **profit‑positive**.\n",
      "\n",
      "---\n",
      "\n",
      "**⚠️ 2 Risks to Watch**\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Over‑reliance on a few cities** – If economic, regulatory, or competitive conditions change in Mumbai or the other top cities, sales could drop sharply. Diversifying marketing spend to emerging regions can mitigate this concentration risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Category‑wide loss exposure** – The three under‑performing categories together erase the entire net profit. If the company continues to carry them without corrective action, it risks **turning a profitable business into a loss‑making one**. Immediate margin‑focused interventions are critical.\n"
