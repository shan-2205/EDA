    "        1. Prompt Engineering\n",
    "            Use smart prompts to improve output Quality of LLMs\n",
    "    \n",
    "    \n",
    "        2. ⭐ RAG \n",
    "\n",
    "            R = Retrieval stage\n",

    "\n",

    "        3. Fine-Tuning\n",

    "\n",
    "            a) Perform a specific task more accurately\n",
