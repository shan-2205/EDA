#normal formulae of Pearson co-relation# 
#we have is for linear aspect ie
#if x inc then y inc 
#then at that time,co-relation is basically one 

#but suppose it is inversely proportional,ie x inc but y dec.. at that it is between -1 to 0




#Now spearman what if we have non linear separable data



#for pearson-corelation
#r=covariance(X,Y)/std.dev(x)*std.dev(y)


#if our data is non_linear separable,prefer spearman co_relation 
#Spearman Pearson co-relation coefficient formulae
#r=covariance(rank(X),rank(Y))/std.dev(rank(x))*std.dev(rank(y))


#Whenever we try to find out co-relation,we use concept of spearman co-relation inside it and we just use heatmap to plot our co-relation
